 * https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-rectangle/#/description
 *
 * For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size.
 * So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page,
 * whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:
 *
 * 1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
 * 2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
 * 3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
 *
 * You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.
